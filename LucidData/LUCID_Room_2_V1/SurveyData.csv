I also think the instructions are mixed: I've been asked if I have any light sensitivity but then right before testing the experience I was advised to keep them closed. I think the Brody chair is very comfy and I call it the business class chair from a plane and just the addition of music and and light doesn't seem anything new from what our nap station offers or the green room. ,Neither likely nor unlikely,Somewhat appropriate,Thank you!
